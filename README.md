This is a coffee store app that allows you find coffee shops near you. This is my first Next JS app that I made live


##How I made this project

#Start by:
``npx create-next-app@latest coffee-finder-app``
``cd coffee-finder-app``
#if you are using VS code:
``code .``
``npm run dev``
#this step can be skipped if you don't like yarn
``install yarn``
#install tailwind
``yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer``
``npx tailwindcss init -p``
#I then followed the instructions on the tailwind website to add the tailwind css to the project and also added the tailwind css to the global css file you can find these instructions here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
